# chef-client CHANGELOG

This file is used to list changes made in each version of the chef-client cookbook.

## 1.1.0

- Someone asked how to record when the client was created in an attribute.

> Note on that. You might want to change it to the `client.pem` file in case there are changes to `client.rb`. I chose the `client.rb` file because it can be tested in kitchen.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.

- Nothing amazing here except it is the initial release
- Times and such are hardcoded for 5 minutes
